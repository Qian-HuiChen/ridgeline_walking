This is an automatic algorithm to find pixels on spiral arms, developed on Auriga simulation. 
Please refer to Chen et al. (submitted) for more details.
This algorithm is written in Python. 
The sample code can be viewed in Jupyter notebook.
An example image (young star mass map of Auriga Halo~23 L3 at z = 0) is given.
