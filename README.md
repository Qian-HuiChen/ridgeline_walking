This is an automatic algorithm to find pixels on spiral arms, developed on Auriga simulation. 
Please refer to **How Mergers and Flybys Shape Azimuthal Age Patterns in Spiral Galaxies (Chen et al. 2025)** for more detailed.
This algorithm is written in python. 
The sample code can be viewed in jupyter notebook.
An example image (young star mass map of Auriga Halo~23 L3 at z = 0) is given.

Please email Qianhui Chen (corresponding author) for a clean and ready-to-use version of this code.
